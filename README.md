### Image Collection CMS

I am creating a custom CMS to serve as a ligntweight implementation of a collection of images held in a database.


### Aimed at Specific Industries

I am going to try and target two different industires wedding photographers and restaurant industry as a way to add a menu and ambience to their website.

### Advantages

Therefore the advantages that this has over a implementation that a developer codes using a database is that the user or customer in this case can edit and create collection themselves using the admin panel part of the website.
